# Skenav: a self hosted file storage server with a web-app
This project is not yet complete. Using skenav in an enterprise environment or for the storage of sensitive information is not currently recommended.

The mission of Skenav is to provide an easy to set up, entirely self hosted, web application for storage of personal files and media, which relies as little on external services as possible.
